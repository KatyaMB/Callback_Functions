**Higher Order Function**
This project was meant to mimic a higher order function's behaviour that already exists, however it was created to further 
my understanding of higher order functions. It takes an array of 10 words where three of the words have 6 letters, it returns a boolean based on whether 
or not a words has six letters.

**Callback Function**

Using the set interval and clear interval function I created a button counter that starts and stops the counter in the console. 
When the button is clicked, it outputs to the console every 1,000ms starting from 1. When the stop button is clicked, it stops all output.
